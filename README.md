## LearnNext, a flashcard learning application made in NextJS

To gain experience in NextJS I decided to create a flashcard learning application. The web app consists of two pages:
Create and Learn. On the Create page, you can create flashcards and save them as .csv files. When this is done, one
can go to the learn page and import the .csv file. When this is done, some quiz settings such as the shuffling of the deck,
case sensitivity and the the number of repititions per card can be adjusted. Next, you will be asked to type the translation
of the flashcards. When all the cards are correct, the user will receive some statistics of the learning session.


For this project I used NextJS with TypeScript and Tailwind. NextJS was completely new for me, although I did have previous
experience with ReactJS.
